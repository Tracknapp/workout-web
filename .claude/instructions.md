# Project Instructions

## Package Management

- **ALWAYS** use `pnpm` for all package management operations
- Use `pnpm install` instead of `npm install`
- Use `pnpm add` instead of `npm install <package>`
- Use `pnpm dlx` instead of `npx` (e.g., `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add component`)

## Git Workflow

- **NEVER** commit and push changes automatically
- Always wait for explicit user instruction before running `git commit` and `git push`
- The user will tell you when they want changes committed and pushed
